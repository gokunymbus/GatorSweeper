## Overview
I decided to build my own version of minesweeper called GatorSweeper. I used JavaScript, ReactJS, CSS, and HTML to build the project. I also rely on Jest for unit tests and React Testing library to test some minor interactions with components. 

## Testing Library
On previous projects i always used Jest for unit tests but i also frequently used Enzyme but due to many reasons including: it's no longer maitained, and encourages bad testing practies i have decided to move to using React Testing Library. RTL is a great project that is actively maintained and supports more stable testing practices.
